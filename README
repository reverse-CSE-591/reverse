Automated Vulnerability Analysis Tool 

<<<<<<< HEAD
The tool takes an URL as its input ( the starting point of crawling ) and does the following:
1) Crawls recursively through the URL uncovering all the links and forms that originate from this URL
2) Performs SQL and XSS injection and computes a score.
3) Generates a report containing the scores and their corresponding URLs.

Packages required for running the tool:

Assuming that pip works in the testing machine, the following command needs to be executed.
The package python-pip needs to be installed using apt-get.

1) Scrapy:

pip install Scrapy

2) Beautifulsoul

pip install beautifulsoup4

3) nltk

pip install -U nltk

TO RUN THE APPLICATION:

python driver.py

The tool is an interactive tool that takes input from the command line. The following input parameters are required to test it.
Start URL - 
Cookie key -
Cookie Value -
(As many cookies can be given)

The inputs can also be given in a text file and the standard input can be redirected to this file. The input file must be given in the following format:

https://129.219.253.30:80/
cse591
kP047iYtubEZ6ZnMKmxO
X

The character 'X' would terminate the passing of inputs.

Once the application is done running, the following files are generated
crawledURLs.txt --> File containing the list of crawled URLs.
formdata.json --> JSON file containing the form data and URLs. 
reverse_report --> Report file that contains the vulnerabilities.
reverse_response --> HTTP response generated after injection attacks.
